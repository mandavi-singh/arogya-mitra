# Arogya Mitra 🤖💊

Arogya Mitra is a **Healthcare AI Assistant** built using Google's **Gemini Pro (Generative AI)** model via `google-generativeai`. It helps users understand symptoms and suggests preliminary medical advice — just like a digital health companion. Built with `Streamlit`, it's easy to use and deploy!
This is an AI-based healthcare assistant that uses machine learning models like **Random Forest** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to predict possible diseases based on user-input symptoms.
